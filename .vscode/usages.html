        <li>AI-powered intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) in mathematics education work by simulating the guidance of a human tutor through adaptive technologies. These systems analyze student input in real time—such as answers to math problems or interaction patterns—and use machine learning algorithms to adjust the difficulty, pacing, and type of instruction provided. For example, if a student struggles with solving linear equations, the ITS may offer simpler problems, provide hints, or switch to visual explanations. Some systems, like conversational AI tutors, engage students in dialogue to clarify misunderstandings and reinforce concepts. These platforms often include features like automated feedback, personalized learning paths, and performance tracking, which help both students and teachers monitor progress and identify areas needing improvement. The U.S. Department of Education highlights that such systems can enhance learning by offering immediate, tailored feedback and supporting students who may not have access to traditional tutoring.</li>
